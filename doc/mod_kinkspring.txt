Capacitors
----------
Blocks that sit inline of buildcraft energy. Receives energy on one side and outputs it on
the opposite side, buffering in between. Use a wrench to rotate.

By default all capacitors charge up to a certain amount of energy before they begin to
discharge. Depending on the type of capacitor, this behavior may or may not be configurable.
Additionally, all capacitors have certain behaviors that are activated when they start to
receive power in excess of their storage capacity.

Capacitors have configurable redstone behavior:
 - do nothing (default)
 - emit redstone when full
 - emit redstone unless full
 - emit power when redstone is applied
 - emit power unless redstone is applied

Gearbox
-------
Blocks that sit inline of buildcraft energy. Receive energy on any one side and output on any
one side. Name and final behavior pending.

Gears require a minimum amount of built up energy before turning. They then output that same
amount of energy over a set period. For example, a gearbox with an inertia rating of 30MJ will
wait until it has received 30MJ before outputting juice.

Once the gears start turning, their output ratio determines the size of output pulses. This
means that a 1:3MJ gearbox will output 3MJ every 3 ticks. A 2:10MJ gearbox would output 10MJ
pulses every 5 ticks.
