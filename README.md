Kinkspring
==========

A Minecraft mod for buffering Buildcraft energy.

This mod is a response to my incresing aggravation at buildcraft for providing no native method for energy storage. All
buildcraft powered systems are inherently wasteful - even if great care is taken to regulate flow. This is even more
obvious in SMP than in single player - when a single accidentally powered combustion engine might burn through an entire
oil well without doing anything useful with the power...

The main items introduced by this mod will be capacitor blocks. These blocks, when placed in a buildcraft power grid,
will buffer and control the discharge rate of input. Most capacitor blocks I have planned are not quite the same as
the battery boxes provided in the core of other tech mods, but they fill much the same role.
